# Arduino header file for notes / tones

This is a simple header file you can download and include into your library path (it's created in Visual Studio Code), for you to easily reference **notes** instead of always referencing the different frequencies.

>Reference f.ex NC2 (Note C2) instead of it's corresponding frequency (65Hz)

Feel free to add more; This is just a simple start to get you going ;-)

HAVE FUN!
